# Hong Kong Town Gas online meter data submitter
This project is to provide an easy way to submit meter data to the online website of Hong Kong Town Gas Corp.
The usage is simple. You only need to provide your account ID on you bill and the data on the meter. Input them as paramters to the command as:

`python3 main.py -a your_account_id -v value_on_the meter`

The command will automatically update the data to Town Gas Corp. 

This toy command have worked for me for serval years, especiall during the covid-19 pandemic lockdown period.
